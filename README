RTG is for Real-Time Graphs

It's a lightweight web service written in Go with API handler receiving data for graphs and another handler to view graphs with Highcharts.JS engine (See http://www.highcharts.com)

Handlers description:

UPDATE HANDLER:

POST/GET /api/update/<hostname>/<graphname>/
  field1=value1
  field2=value2

  OPTIONAL 
  _ts=<timestamp> - timestamp of data arrived
  _expire=<seconds> - data expiration time (this is graph-wide configuration, use this only once you want to change the value. default is 60 seconds)
