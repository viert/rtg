RTG is for Real-Time Graphs

It's a lightweight web service written in Go with API handler receiving data for 
graphs and another handler to view graphs with Highcharts.JS engine 
(See http://www.highcharts.com)

All the data received are kept in memory only, there is no persistent storage 
so the data will be lost when daemon is restarted. So the service is usable for 
realtime monitoring when the monitored data updates often (once per second 
for example) and expires fast (for example after 1 minute) to see the latest 
picture of the things that are happening just right now - current server 
loadaverage, current memory usage, current sockets usage, software thread pools 
state and so forth.
